# Bear classifier
This is a simple image classifier model from the second lesson of the fast.ai [Practical Deep Learning course](https://course.fast.ai).

I trained the bear classifier on a [dataset of 40 images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gwongz/bears-4) retrieved from DuckDuckGo.

The [model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/gwongz/bear-classifier) is built using transfer learning and uses a pre-trained ResNet18 model and is deployed on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/gwongz/bear-classifier-fastai).

Try it out!
